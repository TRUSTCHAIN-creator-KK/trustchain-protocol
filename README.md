# TrustChain Protocol

TrustChain is an AI-powered trust infrastructure designed to verify digital agreements,
prevent fraud, and build reputation systems using cryptographic proofs and blockchain technology.

The internet lacks a native trust layer.
Agreements rely on promises, screenshots, and assumptions.
TrustChain verifies trust — not words.

## Why TrustChain

Digital interactions scale faster than trust.

• Agreements are easy to break and hard to verify  
• Fraud scales globally, reputation remains fragmented  
• Existing systems rely on enforcement instead of prevention  

TrustChain introduces a new approach:
**trust is verified, not promised.**

## Core Components

### 1. AI Agreement Analysis
Analyzes agreement text before signing.
Detects risks, imbalances, unclear clauses, and hidden vulnerabilities.

### 2. On-Chain Proofs
Creates cryptographic fingerprints of agreements.
Lifecycle events are verifiable on-chain without exposing private data.

### 3. Identity & Verification (Optional KYC)
Flexible identity layer.
Users can remain pseudonymous or verify identity for higher trust levels.

### 4. Reputation System
Dynamic reputation scores based on:
• agreement history  
• fulfillment behavior  
• disputes and resolution outcomes  

Reputation is earned, not claimed.

## Design Philosophy

TrustChain is not a contract platform.
It is a foundational trust protocol.

• Modular  
• Transparent  
• Verifiable by design  

Built for long-term digital interaction.
