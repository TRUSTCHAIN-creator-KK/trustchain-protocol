# TrustChain Protocol

TrustChain is an AI-powered trust infrastructure protocol designed to verify digital agreements, prevent fraud, and build reputation on-chain.

## Why TrustChain

The internet still lacks a native trust layer.

Agreements rely on words, screenshots, and assumptions — creating space for fraud, manipulation, and broken promises.

TrustChain introduces a new approach:
**trust is verified, not promised.**

## Core Components

- **AI Agreement Analysis**  
  Detects risks, imbalance, and unclear clauses before signing.

- **On-Chain Proofs**  
  Cryptographic fingerprints of agreements stored on blockchain.

- **Identity & Verification (Optional KYC)**  
  Flexible identity layer for higher trust levels.

- **Reputation System**  
  Dynamic trust scores based on agreement history and behavior.

## Design Philosophy

TrustChain is not just a contract platform.  
It is a foundational protocol for honest digital interaction.

Modular. Transparent. Verifiable by design.

## Project Status

🚧 Early-stage development / research phase  
Private implementation is under active development.

This repository represents the **public protocol vision**.
